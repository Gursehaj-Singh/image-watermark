# Image Watermark

Traditionally, adding a watermark to an image would require the use of image editing software such as Photoshop. Which can take lots of time, especially if you have more than one photo. 

However, with this program, watermarking can be done automatically. For example, if you wish to post photos on Instagram with a website or logo added, the program can automatically apply the watermark to each image.
